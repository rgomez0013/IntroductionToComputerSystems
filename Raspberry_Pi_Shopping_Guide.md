# Raspberry Pi Shopping Guide

### About the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, yet full-featured, credit card-sized computer designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, based in Cambridge, UK. It was originally designed to support computer science education, but has become popular with makers and engineers for its relatively low price and ease of use.

The heart of the Raspberry Pi is a system-on-a-chip (SoC), manufactured by Broadcom. The SoC integrates an ARM processor, GPU, and memory. ARM is the most popular archtecture for embedded and mobile systems. Working with the Pi will give you insight into how a large and important class of computer systems are designed and programmed.

The standard OS for the Pi is Raspbian Linux, a variant of Debian, one of the most popular Linux distributions. The Pi uses a micro SD card for persistant storage of the OS and your files.

### Things You Have to Buy

You will need to purchase the following items:

  - A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or B+ ($35)
  
  - A power supply for the Raspberry Pi (less than $10)
  
  - A micro SD card with at least 16 GB of space (less than $15)

  - An ethernet cable to connect your Pi to your laptop (I recommend getting one ~6 ft. in length.)

  - An ethernet adapter if your laptop does not have an Ethernet port.  If you're unsure about whether or not you need to buy one, bring your laptop and come see me.

All of these items are available from Amazon or other online retailers. AdaFruit and the PiHut are vendors that focus specifically on the Raspberry Pi.

Make sure you purchase the Model 3B or 3B+! There are still old Model 2's around as well as the Model 0, which is intended for lower-cost embedded projects. Neither of those will work for this course.

**SD Cards, NOOBS, and Raspbian**

If you search for Raspberry Pi micro SD cards, you will come across references to cards that come "pre-loaded with NOOBS." NOOBS ("New Out-of-the-Box System") is a program that can boot your Pi and install the Raspbian OS with minimal effort on your part. This is great, but you need an HDMI monitor or TV and a USB keyboard to interact with NOOBS and perform the setup. We don't have that many monitors, so we can't use it to perform the initial OS install in class. Therefore, you **don't** need to purchase a micro SD card with NOOBS.

**Kits**

You can purchase kits that include the Raspberry Pi, power supply, micro SD card, a case, and a few other peripherals for about $70. I did not have good luck with the kits sold by Canakit and I don't recommend them&mdash;among other issues, the Pi didn't fit in the case. If you choose to purchase a kit, read the reviews before committing.  Even if you buy a kit, you may still need to purchase an ethernet cable and/or adapter.  Read the contents carefully.

### Things You Might Want to Buy
    
  - A case
  
  - A toolbox, shoebox, or other container to store all your equipment

**Sensors**

We may do a little Internet of Things work at the end of the course, using the Raspberry Pi to create a small platform that can collect and share data on its environment. This project may require you to purchase a few additional inexpensive sensor components.
